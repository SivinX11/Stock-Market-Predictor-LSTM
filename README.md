</br>
The model was mad in 9 parts:
</br>
</br>1. Importing the data
</br>
2. Feature scaling with Min Max Scaler
</br>
3. Reshaping the training data into an acceptable form of the LSTM
</br>
4. Preparing the Sequential LSTM Model
</br>
5. Compiling the Model and implementing the learning algorithm
</br>
6. Preparing the testing dataset, feature scaling and reshaping
</br>
7. Predicting the data from the testing set
</br>
8. Scaling back the data into Original Format
</br>
9. Visualization of the model prediction
